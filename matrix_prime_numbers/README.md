 
Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.

The program must run from the command line and print to screen 1 table.

Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.

P.s. the prime numbers should be calculated by you, instead use some method from your language.
