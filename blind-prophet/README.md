#Problem

A prophet (P) is lost in his way to the target (R). He is in a discrete space.

    _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ |_
    _ | _ | _ | _ | T | _ |_

    _ | P | _ | _ | _ | _ |_

The prophet can only 

    move(direction)
    distance()
 
When moving, the `direction` can only be `'up'`, `'down'`, `'down'` or `'left'`.
The `distance()` returns the direct distance from the prophet to the target regardless of the direction.
 
Write the algorith for the prophet to reach the target.
