Lets modify the stack data structure to create a new one.

This data structure has 3 methods
All methods must respond in constant time O(1)

````
push(item) 
 # => Pushes an item onto the top of this stack 

pop()      
 # =>  Removes the object at the top of the stack and returns that object

getMin() 
 # => Return the minimal value in the stack
