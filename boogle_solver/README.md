**You'll have to implement a Boggle solver.**
 
Boggle is played on a 4x4 board (there are variants, 5x5, 6x6 but the size is irrelevant for this discussion) and the goal is to find words in the board.

You can go in any of the 8 directions. Go online and look for an example of a Boggle board.

The idea in this problem is given a list of words and a board, decide if you can find all those words in the board.

    boolean IsSolution(Board board, List words)
    
 
 Tell me the Board interface that you need for your implementation.
